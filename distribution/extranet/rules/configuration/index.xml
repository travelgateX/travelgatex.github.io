        Price Calculation With this rule it can be selected if the base commission-markup of the agency and the Selling Pricing Rules have to be applied as a commission or as a markup (just one behaviour can be selected for all pricing).
This rule can be set by agency or by organization on general settings: when defined by agency it can be chosen to set a concrete behaviour or to inherit the value set on the general settings.

        Distribution allows you to make a currency exchange from the currency your suppliers provide you to the currency that your buyers are requesting you. The currency exchange used by default in Distribution is updated every day from the European Central Bank. However, you can customize your own currency exchange using the currency exchange master file to indicate your own base currencye and the exchanges you prefer.
The number of currencies offered by the European Central Bank (ECB) is limited, so in case you need a currency that is not supported by ECB, we can set up an additional exchange supplier offering more than 150 currencies.
