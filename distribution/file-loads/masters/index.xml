        Currencies exchanges Considerations  We can specify global currencies and specific currencies for concrete agencies. If an agency has got specific currencies then this agency will use these ones but if an agency hasn&amp;rsquo;t got specific currencies then this agency will use the global currencies. Global currencies are inherited by agencies with specific currencies in which they are not contained, so if a currency is defined as global and this currency is no defined specifically for an agency then the agency will use de global definition for this currency.
